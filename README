\\ How to make dictionary
------------------------------------------------------------

AlphaDict has opened its dictionary format, see doc/dictionary_inner.pdf,
front-end_format.xml for more detail, encourage you to make your own dictionary.

Usually, you only need to know the 'front-end_format.xml',There are two steps
to make a dictioanry.
1) create a xx.xml accoring to front-end_format.xml.
2) use AlConvert to convert xx.xml to xx.aldict.
   # AlConvert -o xx xx.xml
   AlConvert shall create a dictionary: xx.aldict.
   
AlConvert supports multi-xml files. You can split a large xml into a few files, or
merge a few xml files into a dict.
  # AlConvert -o xx xx.xml  xx_2.xml  xx_3.xml 

doc/alphadict_en-ch.xml is a example, You can use them or refrence them to build your dictionary.
Also, You can get some dictonaries from here:
    "http://pan.baidu.com/s/1o6uhAyQ"


\\ where to put my dictionaries
------------------------------------------------------------

For win32:  'installing direcotry'/dicts
For linux, unix:  /usr/local/share/alphadict/dicts


\\ how to use the third-party dictionary
------------------------------------------------------------

AlphaDict don't support some dict formats directly but provides some tools to convert 
these third-party dictionary to AlphaDict's front-end xml. 

It's a little annoy,does it? Anyway,These tools are all python scripts, pretty simple.
They are easy to use or modify, there are at 
    /usr/local/share/alphadict/tools  -- linux, unix
    'installing direcotry'/tools -- win32.
I will make some dictionaries previously, but the best way is to convert by yourself, 
because these dictionary will be updating from time to time.

# python xx_toaldictxml.py   will show usage.

stardict
------------------------------
1) put all the files of startdict's dictionary to a directory like foo.
   foo/ [foo_xx.idx, foo_xx.ifo, foo_xx.dict]
2) # python stardict_to_aldictxml.py -i foo/foo_xx  -o  foo_xx.xml
3) # AlConvert -o foo_xx   foo_xx.xml
     you will get foo_xx.aldict

You can downlaod the dictionaries of stardict from here:
    "http://abloz.com/huzheng/stardict-dic"


cedict
------------------------------
Currently, only support 'text' format, please download 'text' insteadof 'xml' format.

# python cedict_to_aldictxml.py -i foo.txt
# AlConvert -o foo  foo.xml
    you will get foo.aldict

You can download the cedict dicionary from here:
